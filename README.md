# Instant Messaging App
> A test application to learn & test socket.io

Instant Messaging app builded with JS, with Auth.
With WebSockets you can establish a persistent connection, which allows for bidirectional communication between client and server. Instead of HTTP, with websocket you can have a realtime communication, a less overhead and you can stream data between client and server.
